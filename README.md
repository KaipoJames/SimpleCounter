# SimpleCounter
A simple counter with 3 options: increment, decrement, and reset.

I initially found the idea for this application on youtube. There was an option to take the given code and follow the tutorial however, I decided
to challenge myself to create the application from scratch. First I wrote the html, then the css. Afterwards, I implemented the logic in the 
app.js file and implemented the javascriptcode to make this counter program functional. I am proud to have done all of this by myself. Thank you
for the idea for this application.
